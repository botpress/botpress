Legends spoke of a curse that clung to the area, but few residents dared to speak of it aloud. Outsiders rarely came, and those who did never stayed long. It was the kind of place where the shadows seemed too dark, the silence too heavy, and the nights too long.\n\nCassidy Morgan didn’t believe in curses. She was a journalist, hardened by years of chasing facts and exposing lies. So when her editor sent her to investigate the strange disappearances that plagued the Hollow, she thought of it as just another story. A few locals gone missing? Likely a result of the town's isolation and superstition. She packed her tape recorder, her camera, and her skepticism.\n\nThe first person she interviewed was an elderly man named Elias Grady, one of the town’s oldest residents. His glassy, pale eyes seemed to look through her as he rocked in his creaking chair. \n\n“They come at night,” he whispered hoarsely, his voice barely audible. “Out of the forest. You hear them first. The whispers. They’re soft, like a breeze in the trees, but they ain’t no breeze. They call your name, and if you answer, you’re gone.”\n\nCassidy frowned. “Who’s coming out of the forest? What do you mean, gone?”\n\nElias shook his head violently, clamping his lips shut as if he’d already said too much. She pressed him for more information, but he refused to speak again. Frustrated, Cassidy left his home and decided to explore the forest herself. She wasn’t afraid of shadows or whispers. She was a woman of reason, and she would find answers.\n\nThe forest was dense, the trees gnarled and ancient. They loomed overhead like silent sentinels, their branches twisting together to block out the sky. The deeper Cassidy ventured, the colder the air grew. The quiet was oppressive, broken only by the crunch of leaves beneath her boots. \n\nAnd then she heard it—a faint sound, almost indistinguishable from the rustle of leaves. A whisper. It was so soft she thought she imagined it. But then it came again, clearer this time. \n\n“Cassidy…”\n\nHer heart skipped a beat. She froze, gripping her camera tightly. “Hello?” she called out, her voice trembling despite herself. “Is someone there?”\n\nThe forest answered with silence, but the whisper came again. Closer. Her name, drawn out like a lover’s sigh: “Cassidyyy…”\n\nShe spun around, her breath hitching. Maybe it was one of the townsfolk playing a trick. Maybe Elias had sent someone to scare her. But no one was there. The shadows between the trees seemed to shift, but when she blinked, they were still. She shook her head, forcing herself to keep moving.\n\nThe whispers followed her.\n\nThey grew louder as night fell, calling her name over and over, overlapping until they became a cacophony. Her pulse raced, and her reason began to falter. She tried to retrace her steps, but every path looked the same, every tree identical. The forest was alive, breathing, watching.\n\n“Stop it!” she screamed into the darkness. “Leave me alone!”\n\nFor a moment, the whispers ceased. The silence was worse.\n\nThen she saw them. Figures emerging from the shadows, their forms barely human. Their faces were pale and featureless, their eyes black voids that swallowed the faint moonlight. They moved without sound, their long, spindly limbs bending unnaturally. Cassidy stumbled back, her legs trembling. \n\n“Stay away!” she shouted, fumbling for her camera. She raised it and snapped a photo, the flash illuminating the monsters for a split second. But when she looked at the camera’s screen, there was nothing there. No figures, no shadows—just the empty forest.\n\nThe whispers returned, louder now, deafening. They came from every direction, pressing against her skull like invisible hands. “Cassidy… Cassidy… Come to us…”\n\nHer mind reeled, panic overtaking her. She ran blindly, branches tearing at her skin and hair. The whispers grew louder with each step, until they weren’t whispers at all but screams. Her name echoed in her ears, over and over, until it wasn’t her name anymore. It was something else. Something ancient. Something hungry.\n\nShe tripped and fell, landing hard on the forest floor. When she looked up, she was surrounded. The figures stood in a circle around her, their black eyes unblinking. One of them reached out, its long fingers brushing her cheek. She screamed as her body convulsed, her vision blurring. The world dissolved into darkness.\n\n---\n\nThe townsfolk found her camera three days later, lying at the edge of the forest. There was only one photo on it: a blurry image of the woods at night. Cassidy Morgan was never seen again.\n\nElias Grady sat on his porch, shaking his head as they carried the camera away. “I told her not to go,” he muttered to himself. “They always call for the curious ones.”\n\nAnd as the sun set over Blackthorn Hollow, the whispers began again.","index":0,"stopReason":"stop"}],"usage":{"inputTokens":50,"inputCost":0.000125,"outputTokens":1099,"outputCost":0.010990000000000002},"botpress":{"cost":0.011115000000000002}},"meta":{"cached":true}}}
