# üöÄ LLMz: Next-Gen TypeScript AI Agent Framework

**Build AI agents that think, code, and execute like humans‚Äîpowered by TypeScript and battle-tested at massive scale.**

---

LLMz is the revolutionary framework behind [Botpress](https://botpress.com), empowering millions of AI agents across thousands of use cases worldwide. Unlike traditional tool-calling frameworks, LLMz leverages the massive body of TypeScript knowledge within LLMs, enabling agents to handle complex logic, loops, conditionals, and multi-tool orchestration seamlessly.

**Stop chaining tools. Start generating real code.**

---

## üì¶ Quick Start

Install and start building agents in seconds:

```bash
npm install @botpress/client llmz
```

### ‚ú® Example

```typescript
import { Client } from '@botpress/client'
import { execute } from 'llmz'

const client = new Client({ botId: '...', token: '...' })

const result = await execute({
  instructions: 'Calculate the sum of integers from 1-100 divisible by 3',
  client,
})

console.log(result.output) // 1683
```

## ‚ö° Why LLMz Beats JSON Tool Calling

### Traditional JSON Tool Calling ‚ùå

- Hard-to-parse JSON schemas for LLMs
- Incapable of complex logic, loops, and conditionals
- Multiple expensive roundtrips for each tool call
- Unreliable beyond simple scenarios

### LLMz TypeScript Generation ‚úÖ

- **Billions** of lines of TypeScript training data
- Native LLM thinking via comments and code structure
- Complex logic and multi-tool orchestration in **one call**
- Complete type safety and predictable schemas
- Scales effortlessly in production

## üé¨ Demo: See it in Action!

**Instruction:**

```typescript
'What is the sum of integers between 14 and 1078 divisible by 3, 9, or 5?'
```

**LLMz generates real TypeScript:**

```typescript
let sum = 0
for (let i = 14; i <= 1078; i++) {
  if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 9 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {
    sum += i
  }
}
return { action: 'done', value: { success: true, result: sum } }
```

**Result:**

```json
{ "success": true, "result": 271575 }
```
