/**
 * Example 06: Tool Confirmation Pattern
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to implement user confirmation for destructive operations.
 * It shows how to:
 * - Use ThinkSignal to pause execution and request user confirmation
 * - Implement stateful confirmation workflows
 * - Handle confirmation state management across execution cycles
 * - Use onExit callbacks to manage execution flow
 * - Protect against accidental destructive operations
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - ThinkSignal for interrupting execution flow
 * - Stateful confirmation management
 * - Exit callback handling with onExit
 * - Safety patterns for destructive operations
 * - User consent workflows
