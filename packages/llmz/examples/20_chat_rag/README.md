## RAG / Knowledge Bases

This is an example of how you can implement RAG in your agent as a custom tool. In this example, we leverage Botpress' built-in RAG by uploading 3 documents (IT, HR and Sales related) and support for citations.

The CitationManager is a built-in utility class provided by LLMz to inject and extract citations from your agent's responses.
