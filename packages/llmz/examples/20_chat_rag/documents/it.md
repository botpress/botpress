## üîê IT Security Policies

### 1. Password Management

- Use a password manager (we recommend **1Password**).
- Passwords must be at least 16 characters long and include:
  - Uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Change passwords every 90 days.
- Do not reuse passwords across accounts.

### 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- MFA is mandatory for:
  - Email (Google Workspace)
  - VPN access
  - Admin-level access to internal tools
- Use either **Google Authenticator** or **YubiKey**.

### 3. Device Security

- Company-issued laptops must:
  - Be encrypted using FileVault (macOS) or BitLocker (Windows)
  - Have antivirus software installed (CrowdStrike Falcon)
  - Enable firewall
- Personal devices are **not permitted** to access production environments.

## üõ† Troubleshooting Guides

### 1. VPN Connectivity Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Cannot access internal services
- "Authentication Failed" error

**Steps:**

1. Ensure you're connected to the internet.
2. Open the **NordLayer VPN** app.
3. Select the closest region (usually `us-east-1`).
4. Ensure MFA is successful.
5. If issues persist, reboot and retry.

**Escalation:**
If the issue persists after 3 attempts, contact IT Support via Slack `#it-support`.
