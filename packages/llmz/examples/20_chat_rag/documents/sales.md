## 📞 Sales Scripts

| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Too expensive”                     | “Compared to the cost of agents or lost customers, this pays for itself in 90 days.”                       |
| “We’re already using Intercom bots” | “We often replace or augment Intercom where clients need more powerful workflows and multilingual agents.” |
| “We’re not ready for AI”            | “That’s exactly where we come in—we help teams start small and scale up with confidence.”                  |
| “Send me info”                      | “Happy to! But what should I include to make it most relevant?”                                            |
