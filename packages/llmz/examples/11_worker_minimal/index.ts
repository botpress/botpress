/**
 * Example 11: Minimal Worker Mode
 *
 * This example demonstrates the simplest usage of LLMz in worker mode.
 * It shows how to:
 * - Execute mathematical computations through code generation
 * - Use LLMz without chat interface for one-shot tasks
 * - Access generated code and execution results
 * - Handle success/failure states with proper result checking
 * - Demonstrate the power of code generation over traditional tool calling
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - Worker mode execution (no chat interface)
 * - Mathematical problem solving through code generation
 * - Result inspection with isSuccess()
 * - Code generation capabilities demonstration
 * - One-shot task execution pattern
