/**
 * Example 12: Worker File System Operations
 *
 * This example demonstrates file system operations in worker mode.
 * It shows how to:
 * - Use objects instead of tools for more complex APIs
 * - Implement file system operations (read, write, create directories)
 * - Handle conditional logic based on file existence
 * - Use worker mode for automated file management tasks
 * - Work with exit conditions and structured outputs
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - Object vs Tool patterns (objects provide richer APIs)
 * - File system integration through utilities
 * - Conditional file operations
 * - Worker mode automation
 * - Exit handling with structured data
