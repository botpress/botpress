/**
 * Example 14: Worker Snapshots and State Persistence
 *
 * This example demonstrates LLMz's advanced snapshot system for pausing and resuming executions.
 * It shows how to:
 * - Create snapshots when long-running operations need to be deferred
 * - Serialize and deserialize execution state for persistence
 * - Resume execution from snapshots with resolved data
 * - Handle asynchronous operations that span multiple execution cycles
 * - Implement pausable workflows for better resource management
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - SnapshotSignal for creating execution snapshots
 * - Snapshot serialization and persistence
 * - State restoration and continuation
 * - Asynchronous operation deferral patterns
 * - Execution context preservation
