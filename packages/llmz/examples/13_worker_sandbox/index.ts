/**
 * Example 13: Worker Sandbox and Execution Control
 *
 * This example demonstrates advanced execution control in worker mode.
 * It shows how to:
 * - Implement execution timeouts and cancellation with AbortController
 * - Use execution loops with limited iterations
 * - Create monitoring tools for long-running processes
 * - Handle execution signals and cleanup
 * - Control sandbox execution with safety limits
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - AbortController for execution cancellation
 * - Execution timeout patterns
 * - Loop limits with options.loop
 * - Signal-based process control
 * - Monitoring and checkin patterns for long-running tasks
