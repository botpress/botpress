## Searching the web

This demo shows how Botpress integrations can easily be turned into LLMz Tools.

In this case, we create two tools from the `browser` integration:

- Search the web
- Browse pages

**Note**: Your Botpress bot needs the `browser` integration enabled. It is installed and enabled by default on new bots.
