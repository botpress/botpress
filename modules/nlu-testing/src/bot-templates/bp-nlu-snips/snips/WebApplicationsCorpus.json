I've not checked that it works, but it seems pretty straight forward. The essence is that instead of importing the calendar, you add the URL of your event feed as a public calendar - here's a summary of the steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>In Facebook click on \"Events\"</li>\n<li>Click on \"Export Events\" and copy the URL</li>\n<li>In Google Calendar go to \"Add\" under \"Other calendars\" and choose \"Add by URL\"</li>\n<li>Paste the URL you copied from Facebook and click \"Add\"</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>[Update: to make answer more complete]<br>\nIf you run into issues with private events not showing properly then check out <a href=\"http://eventbusyfix.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\">eventbusyfix.info</a>. This site acts as an inbetween to clear the private flag and enable Gmail to show them properly (Thanks to prestomation for this tip)<br>\n[/Update] </p>\n\n<p>Hope that helps!</p>\n",

By using this, you could have Foursquare update both facebook and twitter without the tweet again updating facebook; and then for normal tweets that you want to push into facebook, include \"#fb\". It costs you a few characters, but it accomplishes your goal.</p>\n",

The answer is Yes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h3>How is spam handled?</h3>\n  \n  <p>Gmail's spam filters also work in your IMAP* client by automatically\n  diverting messages that are suspected of being unwanted messages into\n  '[Gmail]/Spam' and keeping them out of your inbox.</p>\n  \n  <p>If you find a message that should be marked as spam, just move it to\n  '[Gmail]/Spam.' This is just like clicking 'Report Spam' in the Gmail\n  web interface and helps us to improve our spam filters.</p>\n  \n  <p>If you find a message wrongly classified as spam, you can move the\n  message out of '[Gmail]/Spam' to the appropriate folder in your\n  client.</p>\n  \n  <p>Note that your client may have its own junk mail filtering technology,\n  which is separate from Gmail's spam filtering. We recommend using only\n  Gmail's spam filtering and turning off any additional anti-spam or\n  junk mail filters within your client. If you still decide to enable\n  client side spam filtering, your client will download an extra copy of\n  every message.</p>\n  \n  <p><sub>*IMAP: IMAP (Internet message access protocol) lets you download\n  messages from Gmail so you can access your mail with a program like\n  Outlook Express or Apple Mail. IMAP syncs the actions you take in\n  Outlook Express or Apple Mail with Gmail so if you read a message in\n  your mail client, it'll be marked as read in Gmail.</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Taken from <a href=\"http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=78759\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Google Help Article</a></p>\n",

I use the <code>is:spam</code> query with the <code>Never send it to Spam</code> rule in the inbound filter to allow spam to be forwarded. Do note the use of <code>is</code> rather than <code>in</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I imagine you could do the same with the following filter:</p>\n\n<p>Contains <code>is:spam (vigara OR cilais)</code>, Action <code>Delete it</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If you wanted to apply the rule universally, you could instead use:</p>\n\n<p>Contains <code>(is:spam OR -is:spam) (vigara OR cilais)</code>, Action <code>Delete it</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Note that <code>Delete it</code> automatically implies <code>Never send it to Spam</code> so you don't need to check the latter check box. In fact, if you check it, Gmail will uncheck it automatically. I am uncertain as to whether this will impact Gmail's internal spam detection heuristics, but I find that improbable.</p>\n\n<p>Caveat: you cannot delete permanently from a filter rule (I imagine Google believes the risk too great and not worth the potential increase in support costs), so those messages would end up in your Trash and get purged after 30 days. This may still be a better situation to find yourself in, depending on your preferences and the volume of spam you get (which could now make it harder for you to recover messages deleted by mistakes).</p>\n\n<p>If cluttering your Trash is not desirable, you could filter those messages to a temporary label instead, then use an Apps Script to periodically delete \"old\" filtered spam from that label. That would ensure that the top of your Trash is clutter-free. If the volume of spam you receive is limited however, deleting might work just fine.</p>\n",

Or at least \"never send to spam\" but instead moved to a special folder if you want to review them too.</p>\n\n<p>I thought that maybe some <strong>characters</strong> that never show up in your language like ф peraps? But apparently Gmail doesn't search like that, here's a good overview from <a href=\"http://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/58592\">another answer</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Gmail search functionality works based on what I would describe as tokens. A token is any sequence of alphanumeric characters separated by a space or by other non-alphanumeric characters such as underscore, full stop (period), \"@\", dash, etc.. So in peter.ford23@example.com there are 4 tokens: \"peter\", \"ford23\", \"example\" and \"com\".</p>\n  \n  <p>Wildcards within tokens do not work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Gmail only searches by words or parts of emails. Even the <code>.</code> in the examples below may be unnecessary (<code>from:.ru</code> may be the same as <code>from:ru</code>)</p>\n\n<p>Or something like <code>from:.ru</code> should match all messages whose from address contains .ru (I tested <code>from:(.com)</code> that matches anything.com addresses, while <code>from:(.co)</code> matches emails <strong>containing</strong> .co like <code>@yahoo.co.uk</code>.</p>\n\n<p>There may be a combination of \"tokens\"/words in the <code>from:</code>, <code>subject:</code>,<code>body:</code> that might match enough messages...</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There <em>used to be</em> a good language search, but apparently it doesn't work anymore. <a href=\"http://www.labnol.org/internet/gmail-language-filter-reduces-spam/9000/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This guy said</a> that Gmail could search emails by language using <code>lang:[code]</code>, like <code>lang:ru</code> for Russian. More <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/translate/v2/using_rest#language-params\" rel=\"nofollow\">language codes should be here</a>. I don't think I have any emails like that so couldn't test, but trying <code>lang:en</code> didn't show any hits, so it looks like it's no longer available.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Or, you could try a filter for the \"false positive\" spam you frequently see and keep those out of the spam folder, maybe search for your name or something unique? That would probably result in a lot of spam not in the spam folder though.</p>\n",

                "text": "<p>Echofon is notifying you that a Twitter user has mentioned your twitter account in one of their own tweets. In the Twitter web interface, you would see these tweets under the \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/i/connect\" rel=\"nofollow\">@ Connect</a>\" tab, possibly buried under the option labeled \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/mentions\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mentions</a>\".</p>\n\n<p>There are numerous spam bots that will tweet \"at\" you, usually in response to one of your public tweets that mentions a keyword. As you stated, \"webcam\" was one that attracted the bots. Mention of various Apple Computer product names is one that I've seen attract the bots in full force.</p>\n\n<p>When your public tweet brings your Twitter account to the attention of the spambots, they will react. One of the ways in which they react is to reply to your tweet or to \"mention\" you.</p>\n\n<p>You post something like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"My new remote controlled helicopter arrives tomorrow! Hooray!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the spambots respond with:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>@your-twitter-account I know, right? i got mine today from (some spam\n  link)</p>\n  \n  <p>@your-twitter-account FREE HELICOPTER FOR THE FIRST TEN PEOPLE (some\n  spam link)</p>\n  \n  <p>Hey, I think @your-twitter-account is loving his new remote from (some\n  spam link)</p>\n  \n  <p>@your-twitter-acocunt @someone-else #trendinghashtag (spam link) i\n  blah bloop bleep</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When Echofon asks Twitter for a list of your \"mentions\" and/or \"interactions\", the tweets from the spam bots are included in the list. Echofon then notifies you of these tweets.</p>\n\n<p>In a world without spam, this is useful behavior. It facilitates conversations with new people who you might not have otherwise interacted with.</p>\n\n<p>Echofon for iOS recently (<a href=\"http://www.echofon.com/changes/iphone\" rel=\"nofollow\">as of May 8, 2012</a>) gained a new feature: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Refine push notification settings\n  <ul>\n  <li>Added an option receiving mentions notification only from people you follow</li>\n  </ul></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Echofon <a href=\"http://www.echofon.com/changes/windows\" rel=\"nofollow\">for Windows</a> and <a href=\"http://www.echofon.com/changes/firefox\" rel=\"nofollow\">for Firefox</a> do not seem to have such a feature yet.</p>\n\n<p>You could request the feature be added to Echofon, you could tolerate the occasional spam notifications (and report/block the accounts), or you could find another Twitter client that has a feature to suppress notification of mentions from accounts you do not follow.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck!</p>\n",

Mint was just purchased by Intiut so they probably haven't had time to get Canada integration since Mint was a smaller company.  I would try the Intuit one first as they are such a large and old org that if they don't support Canada then no one probably does.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Wesabe.com would have been another option but they have closed down as of this month.</p>\n",
