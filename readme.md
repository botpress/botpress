## Contributing

We love contributions from the community!

We welcome pull requests and issues relevant for any code contained in this repository. See the [This Repository](#this-repository) section for more details.

For bugs or features related to the API, Botpress Dashboard or the Botpress Studio, please talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/botpress) instead!

For any problem related to on-premise Botpress v12, please see the [Botpress v12 repository](https://github.com/botpress/v12).

## Integrations

The [`/integrations`](./integrations) folder contains all our public and open-source integrations. We invite the community to contribute their own integrations to Botpress Cloud.

### Integration Development

To develop an integration, start by installing the [Botpress CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botpress/cli):

```sh
npm install -g @botpress/cli # for npm
yarn global add @botpress/cli # for yarn
pnpm install -g @botpress/cli # for pnpm
```

Then, in the directory of your choice, create a new integration:

```sh
bp init
```

This command will generate an integration from one of the proposed templates.

_This step can be executed in any directory and git repository of your choice. You don't have to fork this repository to create an integration._

You can then modify both the definition and implementation of your integration respectively located in the `integration.definition.ts` and `src/index.ts` files.

For more information on how to develop an integration, please refer to the [Documentation](https://botpress.com/docs/getting-started-1).

### Integration Deployment

To try out your integration, you can deploy its current version to your workspace using the Botpress CLI:

```sh
bp deploy
```

This will deploy your integration's current version to your workspace and make it available to all your bots. If this version is already deployed, it will be updated. Otherwise, a new version will be created.

By default, all integrations are private to the workspace they have been deployed in. When you are ready to share your version with the community, you can make it public by running:

```sh
bp deploy --public
```

This will make your integration available to all Botpress users on the [Botpress Hub](https://app.botpress.cloud/hub). Once a version of your integration is public, it cannot be updated again.

## Bots

The [`/bots`](./bots) folder contains examples of bots "_as code_" made only using the client, the SDK and the CLI.

**This is not the recommended way to build bots** and is in no way a replacement for the Botpress Studio.

However it can be useful for experienced developers who want to build bots in a more programmatic way.

It is also used internally by the Botress team since the Studio and CLI both use the same underlying primitives.
