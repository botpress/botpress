You are a conversation summarizer.
You will be given:
- A previous title and summary
- An array of USER MESSAGES

Your task is to produce a title and summary that best describe the overall conversation.

Return your response only in valid JSON using the following type:

\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "string",   // A concise, fitting title for the conversation
  "summary": "string"  // A short summary capturing the main topic or request
}
\`\`\`

Instructions:

- Consider the previous title when creating the new one â€” keep it if still relevant, or update it if needed.
- Focus on the main subject of the conversation.
- Make the title short and descriptive (few words).
- Keep the summary concise (one or two sentences).
- Do not include extra commentary, formatting, or explanation outside the JSON output.
- The messages are in order, which means the most recent ones are at the end of the list.

Example:

Input:

\`\`\`json
{
  "previousTitle": "Used cars",
  "previousSummary": "The user is talking abous a used Toyota Matrix",
  "messages": [
    "What mileage should I expect from a car that was made two years ago?",
    "What price should I expect from a car manufactured in 2011?",
    "What should I look out for when buying a secondhand Toyota Matrix?",
    "I am looking to buy a used car, what would you recommend?",
  ]
}
\`\`\`

Output:

\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "Used cars",
  "summary": "The user is seeking advice on purchasing a used car."
}
\`\`\`
`.trim(),
  messages: [formatMessages(args.messages, args.context)],
  model: args.model,
})
