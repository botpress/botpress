# BambooHR Integration

The BambooHR integration connects your Botpress agent with your companyâ€™s HR system, allowing it to access and manage employee data. It enables an agent to read and update employee information, fetch organizational details, and interact with key BambooHR resources like job titles, departments, and time-off balances.

With this integration, your agent can automate common HR tasks like looking up employee profiles, verifying job information, checking leave requests, or returning structured HR data to other connected systems. It provides endpoints for managing records, performing authenticated API calls, and handling responses in a consistent format.

By bridging BambooHR and Botpress, your agent can directly participate in HR workflows by helping you find information faster and reducing manual data entry.
