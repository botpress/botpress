# Loops Integration

## Configuration

- **API Key - Required:** can be retrieved at [Settings > API > Generate API key](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api]).
- **Webhooks Signing Secret - Required:** [Settings > Webhooks > Signing Secret](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=webhooks). Available only to people with Loops' beta access.

## How to use

### Actions

**Send transactional emails:** \
To send transactional emails using this integration, a template must first be [published](https://loops.so/docs/transactional/guide). The ID of this template as well as the values of its data variables must then be passed as inputs to the `Send Transactional Email` action.

**_Attachments:_** to include attachments, files can either be [uploaded to the workspace](https://botpress.com/docs/api-reference/files-api/how-tos/creating-files) and made available to the integration by adding the following to the Files API call:

```ts
await client.uploadFile({
  accessPolicies: ['integrations'],
  // Rest of the fields
})
```

or can be directly included by entering the file's raw data and MIME content type in the actions input. The first method is useful for sending premade templates while the second allows the user to send personalized content.

### Events

This integration currently supports events related to sent emails (via Botpress or not). Some events, such as an email being opened or a link in the email being clicked, only support campaign or Loop emails. See [Loops' official event docs](https://loops.so/docs/webhooks#email-events) for more information.
