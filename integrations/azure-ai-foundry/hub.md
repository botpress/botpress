# Azure AI Foundry Integration

This integration allows your bot to choose from a curated list of Azure AI Foundry models as the LLM of your choice
for a node, workflow, or skill in your bot.

You must provide an API key and an API base URL. The base URL should be the OpenAI-compatible endpoint for your
Azure AI Foundry deployment.
