# Webflow integration

## Description

This integration allows Botpress bots to directly interact with Webflow’s CMS collections through full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. By connecting your bot to Webflow, you can dynamically manage and display content—such as blog posts, products, or user submissions—without leaving the conversation. Whether it’s retrieving live data, adding new entries, or updating existing ones, this integration turns your chatbot into a real-time content manager for Webflow-powered sites.

## Getting started
