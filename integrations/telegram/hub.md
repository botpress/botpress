## Migrating from version `0.x.x` to `1.x.x`

### Removal of proactive conversations (and proactive users)

- Telegram does not currently support proactive conversations, so any bots using this feature will need to be updated to use the normal conversation flow.

### Removal of dedicated Markdown messages type

- The `markdown` channel message type is being deprecated in favor of integrating this behavior into the base `text` message type.
- This new Markdown behavior (commonmark spec) will allow image Markdown. However, since Telegram does not support mixed message types, it will split the message into multiple messages with images sent in between text messages.

### Addition of message limits

- Telegram has a message length limit of 4096 characters, so that limit has been added to the text parameter in the `text` message payload. Going over this limit will result in the message being rejected.
