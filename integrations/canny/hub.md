## Channels

**Posts Channel:**

- Handles conversations where posts are the main topic and comments are replies
- When users send messages in conversations, they're automatically created as comments on the associated post

## Events

**Webhook Support:**

- Automatically creates conversations when new posts are created in Canny
- Adds messages to conversations when new comments are posted
- The first message in each conversation is the post content, and subsequent messages are comments

# Configuration

To use this integration, you'll need:

1. **API Key**: Your Canny API key (get this from your Canny account settings)

# Author ID

Posts and comments will appear as "Botpress" unless you provide a specific `authorId`.

To use a different author, provide an `authorId` of an existing user in your Canny workspace. You can find available user Ids using the "List Users" action.

# Usage Examples

## Setting up Webhooks

Configure webhooks in your Canny account to point to your Botpress integration endpoint to automatically sync posts and comments as conversations.

# Conversation Flow

1. **Post Creation**: When a new post is created in Canny, a new conversation is started in Botpress
2. **Comment Replies**: When users reply in the conversation, new comments are created on the original post
3. **Thread Management**: Each post becomes a conversation thread with comments as messages
