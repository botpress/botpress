# Uber Eats

The Uber Eats integration connects your Botpress agent with Uber Eats, allowing it to manage orders and react to delivery events in real time.

It enables an agent to fetch and list orders, accept or deny incoming orders, and mark orders as ready for pickup. The integration also listens to Uber Eats webhooks so your agent can respond to order updates, delivery state changes, and fulfillment issues as they happen.

With this integration, your agent can participate directly in restaurant operations by automating order handling, monitoring delivery progress, and triggering workflows based on Uber Eats events. Authentication and token management are handled automatically, providing a secure and reliable way to interact with the Uber Eats API.
