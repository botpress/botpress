This integration allows you to connect your Botpress chatbot with Trello, a
popular project management platform. With this integration, you can easily
manage your projects and tasks directly from your chatbot.

To set up the integration, you will need to provide your **Trello API key** and
**Token**. Once the integration is set up, you can use the built-in actions to
create and update cards, add comments to cards, and more.

For more detailed instructions on how to set up and use the Botpress Trello
integration, please refer to our documentation.
