## Important note

Unfortunately, **automatic configuration is temporarily unavailable**.
We are currently in the process of getting our Gmail integration verified by Google. Once this verification is complete, you will be able to use the automatic configuration method to set up the Gmail integration with just a few clicks. Until then, you will need to create your own OAuth app by following the steps outlined in the `Manual configuration with OAuth` section below.

## Configuration

Due to the sensitive nature of email communication, the Gmail integration requires a secure connection between Botpress and Gmail. To establish this secure connection, you **must** configure the Gmail integration using OAuth.

### Automatic configuration with OAuth

To set up the Gmail integration using OAuth, click the authorization button and follow the on-screen instructions to connect your Botpress chatbot to Gmail.

When using this configuration mode, a Botpress-managed Gmail application will be used to connect to your Gmail account. However, actions taken by the bot will be attributed to the user who authorized the connection, rather than the application. For this reason, **we do not recommend using personal Gmail accounts** for this integration. You should set up a service account and use this account to authorize the connection.

#### Configuring the integration in Botpress

1. Authorize the Gmail integration by clicking the authorization button.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect your Botpress chatbot to Gmail.
3. Once the connection is established, you can save the configuration and enable the integration.

### Manual configuration with OAuth

To set up the Gmail integration manually, you must create a Google Cloud Platform project and enable the Gmail API. You will also need to create OAuth credentials, set up a Pub/Sub topic, and configure the integration in Botpress.

#### Creating a Google Cloud Platform project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project by clicking the `Select a resource` dropdown in the top navigation bar and selecting `New Project`.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to create the new project.

#### Enabling the Gmail API

   > This service account is managed by Google and is used to push events to Pub/Sub.
7. Under `Assign roles`, select the role `Pub/Sub Publisher`.
8. Click the `Save` button to grant publish rights to the service account.

#### Generating a shared secret

1. Generate an alphanumeric string to use as a shared secret for signing Pub/Sub push events. We recommend using a string with at least 32 characters. You can use tools like openssl or online password generators to create a secure string.

   - For example, you can generate a secure string using one the following commands:

     ```bash
     # Using openssl:
     openssl rand -hex 32

     # Using nodejs:
     node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

     # Using Python 3:
     python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
     ```

   - You may also use an online password generator to create a secure string:
     - https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/
     - https://1password.com/password-generator

2. Copy the **shared secret** for use in the next steps.

13. Under `Retry policy`, select `Retry after exponential backoff delay`. Set the minimum backoff to `60` second and the maximum backoff to `600` seconds.
14. Click the `Create` button to create the subscription.

#### Authorizing the OAuth application

1. On Gmail, log in to the Google account you want to use with the Gmail integration.
2. Once logged in, go to the following URL in your browser:

   ```
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send&access_type=offline&prompt=consent&redirect_uri=https://botpress.com&client_id=
   ```

   > Make sure to add your OAuth **client ID** to the end of the URL. For example, if your OAuth client ID is `abcd`, the URL should end with `&client_id=abcd`.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to authorize the OAuth application with your personal Gmail account.
4. You will be redirected to botpress.com. **Do not close this page**.
5. Copy the **authorization code** from the URL in your browser's address bar.
   > The authorization code is the string that appears after `code=` and before `&scope=` in the URL.
   > If you have difficulty finding the authorization code in the URL, you may use online tools such as https://semalt.tools/en/url-parser or https://parseurlonline.com.
6. You may now safely close this page.

#### Configuring the integration in Botpress

1. Select the `Manual` configuration mode in the Botpress integration settings.
2. Enter your OAuth **client ID** and **client secret**.
3. Enter the full **topic name**, which starts with `projects/`.
4. Enter the **shared secret** you generated earlier.
5. Enter the **service account email address** you created earlier.
6. Enter the **authorization code** you obtained earlier.
   > Unfortunately, the authorization code is only valid for a short period of time. If the code has expired, you will need to repeat the steps outlined in the `Authorizing the OAuth application` section. If the authorization code is not expired, it will be exchanged for a refresh token, which will be used to authenticate the integration.
7. Save the configuration and enable the integration.

## Limitations

Botpress shall not be held responsible for any costs you may incur on the Google Cloud Platform while using the Gmail integration, should you choose to use the manual configuration mode. Ensure that you are aware of the costs associated with using the Gmail API and the Google Cloud Platform before using the manual configuration mode.

Standard Gmail API limitations apply to the Gmail integration in Botpress. These limitations include rate limits, message size restrictions, and other constraints imposed by the Gmail and Google Cloud platforms. Ensure that your chatbot adheres to these limitations to maintain optimal performance and reliability.

More details are available in the [Gmail API documentation](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/quota).
