# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Auto Email Response feature will enhance the Gmail integration by automatically responding to incoming emails based on configurable rules and templates. This feature will allow users to set up automatic responses for specific scenarios, such as out-of-office replies, acknowledgment of receipt, or intelligent responses based on email content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure automatic email responses, so that I can acknowledge receipt of emails without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new email is received THEN the system SHALL check if automatic responses are enabled
2. WHEN automatic responses are enabled THEN the system SHALL generate and send an appropriate response based on configured templates
3. WHEN sending an automatic response THEN the system SHALL mark the email as responded to prevent multiple responses to the same thread
4. WHEN configuring automatic responses THEN the user SHALL be able to enable/disable the feature globally

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the content of automatic responses, so that they match my communication style and needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up automatic responses THEN the user SHALL be able to define multiple response templates
2. WHEN defining a template THEN the user SHALL be able to include dynamic content such as sender name, original subject, and date
3. WHEN an automatic response is triggered THEN the system SHALL select the appropriate template based on configured rules
4. WHEN sending an automatic response THEN the system SHALL properly format the email with appropriate subject line and content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set conditions for when automatic responses are sent, so that I can have different responses for different situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring automatic responses THEN the user SHALL be able to set time-based conditions (e.g., outside business hours, specific date ranges)
2. WHEN receiving an email THEN the system SHALL check if the sender is in any exclusion list before sending an automatic response
3. WHEN evaluating whether to send an automatic response THEN the system SHALL consider if the email is part of an existing conversation
4. IF an email is detected as automated or bulk mail THEN the system SHALL NOT send an automatic response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track and review automatic responses that have been sent, so that I can ensure they are working as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an automatic response is sent THEN the system SHALL log the event with relevant details
2. WHEN viewing conversation history THEN the user SHALL be able to identify which messages were sent automatically
3. WHEN automatic responses are enabled THEN the system SHALL provide statistics on how many automatic responses have been sent
4. IF an automatic response fails to send THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify the user if configured to do so
