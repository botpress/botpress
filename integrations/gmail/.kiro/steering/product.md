# Product Overview

This is a Gmail integration for Botpress that enables AI chatbots to send, receive, and manage emails directly within bot workflows. The integration provides seamless email communication capabilities, allowing bots to:

- Send emails to specified recipients
- Check inbox for new messages with filtering capabilities
- Retrieve full email content by message ID
- Get user's email address
- Handle real-time email notifications via webhooks

The integration supports both automatic configuration (pending Google verification) and manual OAuth setup with Google Cloud Platform. It uses Gmail API for email operations and Google Pub/Sub for real-time email notifications.

Key features include advanced Gmail search queries, email threading support, rich message types (text, HTML, images, files), and secure OAuth authentication.
