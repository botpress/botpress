(Now that I’m a LinkedIn influencer, I figured my opinion is worth sharing.)

I know many of you are currently learning French, and some of you have asked me for Québec TV shows or movies to get used to the Québec accent.

Last weekend, a friend asked me for a list of influential or iconic Québec songs. It took me a couple of hours to put it together, and I thought it might be useful to share it with all of you.

This is not homework 😄 You don’t even have to listen to a single song if you don’t want. Pick a few, see what sticks, or ignore them entirely.

I picked the songs based on a few criteria:

- Total Spotify listens
- Cultural or historical relevance
- Whether I like the song and think it still holds up today

Sorry if your favorite song isn’t on the list. I tried my best to remain objective, but it’s obviously influenced by my own tastes.

I also tried to keep things balanced:

- Songs from every decade since the 50s
- Only mainstream, well-known songs
- No artist appearing more than once

If by any chance digging a Québec song makes you want to practice your French a bit more, then it’s already worth it.

If you end up liking any of them, let me know; I might be able to suggest a few more in the same vein.

While working on the list, I was surprised to see how big and impactful the 90s were for Québec music. I had to leave a lot of good songs out. I think it’s the strongest decade here and a good starting point.
