(Now that I’m a LinkedIn influencer, I figured my opinion is worth sharing.)

I know many of you are currently learning French, and some of you have even asked me for Québec TV series or movies to get used to the Québec accent.

Last weekend, a friend asked me for a list of influential or iconic Québec songs. It took me a couple of hours to put together, and I thought it might be useful to share.

**This is not homework** 😄 You don’t even have to listen to a single song if you don’t want. Pick a few, see what sticks, or ignore them entirely.

I picked the songs based on a few criteria:

- Total Spotify listens
- Cultural or historical relevance
- Whether I like the song and think it still holds up today
- With lyrics; nothing instrumental or with too few words
- Songs from every decade since the 50s
- Only mainstream, well-known songs. (Obviously, songs from the 50s aren't considered mainstream today, but they were back then.)
- No artist appearing more than once

Sorry if your favorite song isn’t on the list. I tried my best to remain objective, but it’s obviously influenced by my own tastes. If by any chance digging a Québec song makes you want to practice your French a bit more, then it’s already worth it. If you end up liking any of them, let me know; I might be able to suggest a few more in the same vein.

Personal thoughts:

- 90s is probably the strongest decade here and a solid starting point.
- 80s feel like the weakest decade, though maybe that’s just because I’m not that into the 80s sound in general.
- If you plan on listening to only one song, it should probably be "Les étoiles filantes" by Les Cowboys Fringants.
